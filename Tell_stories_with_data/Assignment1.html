<div>In this assignment, I used three different kinds of charts. I first used bar chart to show the data distribution of goverment Debt-to-GDP ratio of 2018. For the second chart
 I use grid line chart to show the Debt-to-GDP ratio change between 1995-2021 for different countries and also the comparsion of trends between these countries.
 For the third visualization, I use dot chart to show a dynamic change for different years of how the ratio change within the value internval in the time range of 1995-2021</div>
 <div> Bar chart is better for showing the distribution of data, Line chart is better for showing the trend of data, the grid of chart is better to compare the difference between 
 different charts and the dot chart is better for showing the comparison of different data points.</div>
