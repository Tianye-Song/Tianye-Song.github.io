The title of the graph: The ISHANT'S ECONOMY RATE

Changes I made for the first sketch:
* I change the type of the chart from accumulate bar chart to line chart because this is time series data, so line chart could show the trend better.
* I change the color of the two features, the orignal color are too similar to each other, people could not tell the difference of them.
* I change the title of the chart so it could summarize the information in the chart.

Suggestion from other people:
* People A: Use dual axis because the two features are in different scale

* People B: 1. Change the title 2. Delete the data points on the graph which are not useful

Changes I made after the suggestions:
* I change the title to show accurate meaning of the graph.
* I use dual axis because of the different scales of the two features to show the trend more clearly.
