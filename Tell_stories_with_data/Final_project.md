# Final Project Part 1

For Part I of the final project, I selected the project topic that I could inform the audience through data visualization. I created an outline of the project, got the working copy of all datasets I'll need for the project, created my first sketches, and identified the method and medium I'll use for presenting the information as a final product.

# Final Project Part 2

In Part II, I continued constructing and refining the actual narrative that will take the reader on the journey through my story.  I worked with a number of different artifacts, developing wireframes and storyboards and conducting user research on my idea.

# Final Project Part 3
In Part III, my final deliverable was complete and publicly accessible as a digital asset and I've published my story on Shorthand.
