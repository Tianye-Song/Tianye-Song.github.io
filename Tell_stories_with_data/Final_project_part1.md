# Outline

**Summary of the project**

What is your happiest moment in the past 24h? In my final project, I will visualize the distribution of people's happy moment in differnet categories and
the distribution of words from subject's, verb's, and object's perspectives according to the survey data. 

**Structure**

1. Ask the audience their happiest moment in the past 24h. 
2. Show the audience the happy moment category distribution accoridng to the survey data.
3. Show the happy moment subject distribution and the distribution of different categories for the top 1 subject. 
4. Show the happy moment verb distribution and the distribution of different categories for the top 1 verb. 
5. Show the happy moment object distribution and the distribution of different categories for the top 1 object.

# Data

[HappyDB](https://github.com/megagonlabs/HappyDB)

Introduction of the data: HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments. More specifically, the collaboration between the University of Tokyo, MIT, and Recruit Institute of Technology asked participants on Mechanical Turk to list 10 happy moments. This generated a corpus of 100,000 happy moments called HappyDB.

How to use the data: I will clone the repository from github to download the data to local path and analyze the data with python.

# Medium
[shorthand](https://shorthand.com/)

I will utilize shorthand for the presentaton, Tableau to prepare charts with data and python to analyze data for the final project.
