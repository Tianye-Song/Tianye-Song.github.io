# Target Audience
For the final project, my topic is "What's the secret of happiness", I chose this topic because nowadays people are getting less happier and people around me including me feel stressed these days. 
Therefore, I thought I want to explore if there is any way to make people feel happy. My targeted audience for this project is anyone who want to cheer themselves up
or anyone who is interested in happiness. 

# Designing process

Based on the interview results, I narrowed the contents and the focus of the storyline. It seems like people are more interested in what things make the other people feel happy in their
daily life, what categories these examples fall into and what subjects, verbs and objects appears the most in the database collected from the survey. 

I construct the whole storyline according to the structure learnt from the course in a sequence of setup, conflicts and action. The setup is about nowadays people are getting less happier and always being unhappy does harm to people's physical health. The conflicts is that happiness doesn't need complex
activities and the action is about according to the analysis of the [HappyDB](https://megagon.ai/happydb-a-happiness-database-of-100000-happy-moments/) , there are many simple things people could do to be happy. When I am designing the stories on shorthand, I changed several times about how to organize the graph and text and how to use animation to make points stand out in a clearer way.



# Graph Design
For most of the graphs used in the presentation, I used [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) to design them.
For the final graph of the presentation, I was inspired by the analysis of [What Makes People the Most Happy](https://flowingdata.com/2018/06/21/what-makes-people-the-most-happy/) by Nathan Yau. Based on the analysis in this document, 
I also added the category distribution for different objects to present example senteneces from the database. I first used Flourish to draw the stacked bar distribution graph based on the analysis with Python with HappyDB. After that, I used [Xmind](https://xmind.app/) to design the Mind graph.
